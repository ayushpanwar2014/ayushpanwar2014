## ⚡ Fun fact
- **Did you know that the MERN stack, which I use to build awesome apps like FoodoMart and Prescripto, is named after its core technologies—MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js—but it’s also a playful nod to the word "modern"? It’s like the cool kid of web development stacks, making full-stack coding as smooth as a perfectly optimized API call! 😎 Want to geek out about how I slashed unauthorized access by 80% in a healthcare app? Just ask!**
